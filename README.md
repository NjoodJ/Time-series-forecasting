Utilized Facebook's Prophet library for time series forecasting. Developed accurate predictions by leveraging Prophet's advanced modeling techniques. The project showcased proficiency in forecasting future values based on historical time series data.

## Data
The dataset should contain two columns: "ds" (timestamp) and "y" (time series values). Ensure that the timestamp column is in a valid datetime format. In this project, the dataset covers the period from 1981-01-01 to 1990-12-31, and the forecasts were generated until 1991-12-31.
